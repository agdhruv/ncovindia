So unless some subpart (e.g. an adhesive) melts, the mask should be fine.</p> <p>Washed and boiled masks should be mask free. However, we don't know if it will still be as effective as a new mask in giving protection against pollution or small particulates.</p> <p>Cycling:</p> <p>The virus lasts for less than a week on most surfaces, and lasts for less than a day on cardboard and similar material. Cycling two or three masks should also be an effective measure. However, we suggest you cycle masks AND wash them before next use to be extra cautious.<p>",
